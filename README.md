# Final-Project-Python
   Sales in Retail Store

The aim of this project is to clean, process, and visualize a real-life dataset using Python.
The project focuses on improving data quality, handling missing or incorrect values, and generating meaningful visualizations to understand patterns and insights.

PHASE 1 :- **Data Loading and Initial Overview.**

The dataset was successfully loaded and inspected to understand its structure, data types, and size. Initial checks identified numerical and categorical variables, along with missing values and inconsistencies in some columns such as item names, prices, quantities, and discount information.

PHASE 2 :- **Data Pre-processing.**

Data cleaning steps were performed to improve data quality. Missing values were handled appropriately using statistical methods, duplicate records were removed, and data types were corrected (for example, converting dates and numerical fields). New derived columns such as Discount Percentage and Price After Discount were created to support deeper analysis.

PHASE 3 :- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).**

EDA revealed key patterns in customer purchasing behavior. Total Spent is strongly influenced by Quantity and Price Per Unit, while payment methods show minimal impact on spending. Sales are evenly distributed across customers and categories, with online and in-store channels contributing almost equally. Discounts are applied frequently and appear to encourage purchases rather than significantly increasing transaction value. Category and location together play an important role in shaping sales performance.

PHASE 4 :- **Visualizations.**

Multiple visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots were used to support the analysis. These visuals clearly highlighted sales distribution, category performance, customer behavior, discount effects, and relationships between key variables. Proper labels, titles, and legends ensured clarity and effective communication of insights.

**Conclusion**

Overall, the analysis shows that sales performance is driven by a combination of product category, quantity purchased, pricing, and sales channel, with consistent customer behavior across payment methods. The insights gained can help improve pricing strategies, promotional planning, and category-level decision making.
